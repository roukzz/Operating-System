file name that's I'm sure it works is "testfile2.txt"
help Command: by typing help it shows how to use the OS.

Main: implementing a simple Operating System which is capable of doind some command like. this OS has a shell memory ans it is able to 
set some variable to some value as the user decides and can also retrieve it. can also executes scripts with the known command.

challenge:my purpose was to recreate how OS works. so  if you want to execute 2 or 3 scripts to execute (programs), it has to give some quata to each program. the challenge for me was to alternate between them and if the program was too big then i had separate the program into pages holding in the backing store. then, called into ram when needed.
